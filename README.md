# derm-detect-ui
 I was tasked with solving the problem of creating an app to support students at my school with day-to-day activities. This would involve entering their schedules, getting updates on extracurriculars and the lunch menu and calendar updated with school events. This brings us to the planning process. First, the app screens and flow were planned using figma. And the logo was designed with logo makers. For both of these I made sure to make them distinct by incorporating our school colors of royal blue, black and white. te. Next brainstormed what data would be needed and how they would be stored. The option for these included storing them in a collection or as individual documents in firebase. For the layout and navigation, I decided to use the navigation layout in android studio. This would allow the user to view each distinct feature using the sidebar. 
 Packaging is simple. In app/src/java folder, there are is all the java code including the activities and the ui package for fragments. The UI package has code for each naviagatin activity. The Res/drawable has all the vector icons, and Res/Layout has the necessary Layout Resource Files for each Activity
